# AntiShadowPatch

## Info

Recently Mojang started to shadow-patch a lot of technical bugs that many technicals players liked.
**AntiShadowPatch** is a mod that aims to reimplement them.

You can configure every setting individually in antishadowpatch_config.json

## But Carpet Fixes does the same!
Yes, Carpet Fixes also reintroduces most of the bugs, but I thought it would be a good idea 
to make a separate mod for shadow patches only. That way, it can be updated 
faster, and new features will also be added faster.

However, things that weren't in vanilla(like update suppression crash fix) would not be added to the mod.
